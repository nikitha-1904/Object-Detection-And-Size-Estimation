# Object-Detection-And-Size-Etimation
In image processing, digital images are analyzed and modified using computer algorithms for tasks like filtering, enhancing, and recognizing. It is used in various industries such as robotics, entertainment, medical imaging, and agriculture. This project uses image processing to measure the size and distance of objects, focusing on veggies without physical contact. It integrates AI and IT to improve agricultural efficiency. The use of modified Canny edge detection and Multiscale Faster-NN algorithms enables real-time measurement and flaw identification.
The main algorithms adopted here are e Detectron2, Faster-RCNN and Canny Edge Detection. 
Detectron2 : 
Detectron2, created by Facebook AI Research, is an open-source software framework for object detection and image segmentation based on the PyTorch deep learning framework. It offers a range of modern object detection and segmentation models, including Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. Additionally, Detectron2 includes capabilities for distributed training, mixed-precision training, and multi-GPU training, enabling faster and more effective model training, making it a popular choice for both academic research and business applications. This tool is valued for its accuracy, ease of training on custom data, and speed and scalability, surpassing the capabilities of previous versions like Detectron.
# Faster-RCNN : 
Faster R-CNN is a two-stage object detection algorithm using a region proposal network (RPN) to identify candidate object areas and a Fast R-CNN network to classify and refine bounding boxes. The RPN generates proposals based on objectness score and overlap with ground truth objects. This approach combines speed and precision, outperforming older techniques. It requires significant computational resources and training data but has been applied in self-driving cars, security systems, and image search engines.
# Canny Edge Detection : 
Canny edge detection is widely used in image processing for its precise edge detection and noise reduction capabilities. The algorithm's multi-stage approach and careful parameter selection result in resilient and reliable edge detection. It helps reduce the total amount of data processed while extracting structural information and is commonly used in computer vision systems. The OpenCV Canny() function is utilized for edge detection, and it is known for producing smoother, cleaner images compared to previous algorithms.
# About Dataset :
In order to train key point detection networks, a vegetable key point dataset was compiled, comprising 400 photos of four common vegetables: Cucumber, Brinjal, Tomato, and Capsicum. Each category consists of 100 images, with 80 for training, 10 for testing, and 10 for validation. Each image includes a Region of Interest (ROI) box and key points for Top, Left, Bottom, and Right of the primary object, facilitating vegetable size estimation using fewer key points to simplify the model. The Left and Right key points are used for diameter estimation, while the Top and Bottom key points are utilized for length calculation.
# Methodology :
We Preprocess the dataset images and acquire RGB images and depth maps of vegetables. The images go through edge detection and are then processed using Detectron2's Faster R-CNN for vegetable identification. The process involves Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for feature extraction, Regional Proposal Network (RPN) for object region identification, and ROI Heads for key point and box detection. Multiscale detection is employed to identify objects of varying sizes, and size estimation is achieved by utilizing annotated XML files and applying a pixel distance to centimeter measurement conversion using the Euclidean Distance formula. The pixel points are output by networks, and their separation is calculated and converted to centimeters.
