# Object-Detection-And-Size-Etimation
This project uses image processing to measure the size and distance of objects, focusing on veggies without physical contact. It integrates AI and IT to improve agricultural efficiency. The use of modified Canny edge detection and Multiscale Faster-NN algorithms enables real-time measurement and flaw identification.
